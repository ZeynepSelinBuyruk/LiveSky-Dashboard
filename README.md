#LiveSky Dashboard

A professional, lightweight, and high-performance weather dashboard built with Vanilla JavaScript. This project focuses on efficient API integration, clean asynchronous logic, and a dynamic user experience.

#Key Features

Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches instantaneous atmospheric insights using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Dynamic UI Experience: Automatically updates backgrounds and iconography based on real-time weather conditions (e.g., transitions for rain, snow, or clear skies).

Intelligent Search: Provides detailed metrics including "Feels Like" temperature, humidity levels, and wind speed.

Robust Error Handling: Implements comprehensive catch-blocks to handle invalid city queries or network failures gracefully.

Fully Responsive: Designed with a Mobile-First approach, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

#Technical Implementation

Modern JavaScript (ES6+): Utilizes async/await for clean, readable asynchronous operations.

Fetch API: Efficiently handles network requests without the overhead of external libraries like Axios.

DOM Manipulation: Optimized rendering logic to ensure smooth UI updates without performance bottlenecks.

Zero Dependencies: Built entirely with Vanilla JS, CSS3, and HTML5 to demonstrate core engineering competencies.
